# Wish list 
# 	- get rid of ssl error 
#	- skip webm - pirorities mp4 (at least not under ADP) 
#	- deal with network failures. 
#	- deal with resume on socket. (resume partial downloads) 
#	- deal with youtube 404
#	- don't say 'Enjoy the video' when there is no download.
#	- maintain a trace and don't redownload what you have already got. 
# 	- skip what is already downloaded 
#	- where and how to keep the trace? what is the file format? 
#	- capture critical stuff and do clean exit when user presses Ctr+C 
#	- you can also check if the file is physically present. 
#	- needs to see that duration available locally matches with what is claimed by YT
#	- list control - follow list, pause, stop and resume post what is finished. 
#	- if somethings fail / skip that download item, and go on to next. 
#	- maintain csv generator that can keep the trace. 
#	- read list file which can be a CSV - as extracted by channel decoders / playlist decoders etc. 
#	- mark column that will allow users to select/deselect files required to download (?) 
#	- parallel thread downloading 
#	- proper logging on per download basis. (vid.log) independent of stdout for basic purpose. 
#	- bring ffmpeg output to perstream log 
#	- ffmpeg -vcoded copy doesn't work! 
#	- generalize the output file format 
#	- downalod_stream function should provide data of actual status and details of download (put it to trace)
#	- get watch page to retrive the play duration - dont' need to downloard the full thing for it. 
#	- download captions and convert it to srt that VLC can play 
#	- prefer p60 over p30 videos
#	- network reconnect should re-establish things
#	- move to python3
#	- mkdir if folder for -f doesn't exist. 
#	- ask if the file to be downloaded already exists
#	- yl format to have critical info when created by extract e.g. resolution, author, timelength, cc/no-cc etc.
#	- probe for file size in yl format? 
#	- fetch can be directly given -p/-c/-u (for playlist,channel,user respectively) without calling extract.
#	- instead of pretty print. Video meta can be explained in more human readable format. 
#	- generic methods/ or customzable file titles. 
#	- generic policies in what to fetch : AudioOnly/VideoOnly/AV, Max res, 
#	- post processing of video. e.g. convert to mp3
#	- in case of multiple parallel downloads, the current \r funda won't work. So need central reporting engine.
#	- If youtube throws 404/403 - in actual downloads. it should not proceed like a normal flow. Exception should be handled.
#	- Deal with signatured streams that otherwise throws 403 (e.g. '-RMD88DNaGk') 
#	- MD5 or play duration verification of Media files (large ones) 
#	- Resume incomplete downloads from where they were left 
#	- there exists custom urls for channels. see https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced
#	- my own channel is different from std (makemegenious) https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzvGqEme9-yngxiYXY_Zk7A
#	- tabs being compulsory in .yl files is a problem, specially when the files are handwritten. 
#	- fetch can now be given multiple uid_references which it can download all serially
#	- now the .yl in turn can have references to full channel, playlist etc. expand all of them before download 
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Code TODO 
#	- clean up overall flow of messages on console and in logs 
#	- use exceptions instead of status codes/errors in most return calls
# 	- generalized function for page download 
#	- generlize id from url for watch, playlist, channel 
#	- get rid of print_stream_map functions. Simplify with pretty_print 
#	- make item logger global (how will you handle in multithread situation?) 
#	- centrlized all standard strings (including youtube.com/xxx where we are assuming known url 
#	- get rid of print_smap_XXX functions and no extra return value from parse_stream_map 
#	- move pretty_print to ytuitls 
#	- reduce/remove dependency on logr from most possible lower level functions 
#	- rename dlItem to something better. That is the base object for getting info!
# 	- function that extract meta info will be out from fetch so extract can use it. 
#	- generalize get_watch_page into different types of page e.g. playlist, channel/user etc. 
#	- cleanup title is actually now part of download_streams. so should not be in utils 
#	- keep all common strings in a central place 
#	- it's time, the code must have classes for important stuff. 
#	- pretty_print to take care of list specially?
#	- id from url should also be generalized for video/playlist/channels/user 
#	- geting page, streams and captions all have different types of download functions. Generalize!
#	- simplify format which get_uid_from_ref provides and read_list generates into common format. 
#	- load_list of different type should come with simple and single abstraction. 
#	- list should now be generlized and should be out from extract into ytlist
#	- list should be able to deal with all types of lists : channel, user, playlist, ytlist
