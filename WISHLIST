# Wish list 
# 	- get rid of ssl error 
#	- skip webm - pirorities mp4 (at least not under ADP) 
#	- deal with network failures. 
#	- deal with resume on socket. (resume partial downloads) 
#	- deal with youtube 404
#	- don't say 'Enjoy the video' when there is no download.
#	- maintain a trace and don't redownload what you have already got. 
# 	- skip what is already downloaded 
#	- where and how to keep the trace? what is the file format? 
#	- capture critical stuff and do clean exit when user presses Ctr+C 
#	- you can also check if the file is physically present. 
#	- needs to see that duration available locally matches with what is claimed by YT
#	- list control - follow list, pause, stop and resume post what is finished. 
#	- if somethings fail / skip that download item, and go on to next. 
#	- maintain csv generator that can keep the trace. 
#	- read list file which can be a CSV - as extracted by channel decoders / playlist decoders etc. 
#	- mark column that will allow users to select/deselect files required to download (?) 
#	- parallel thread downloading 
#	- proper logging on per download basis. (vid.log) independent of stdout for basic purpose. 
#	- bring ffmpeg output to perstream log 
#	- ffmpeg -vcoded copy doesn't work! 
#	- generalize the output file format 
#	- downalod_stream function should provide data of actual status and details of download (put it to trace)
#	- get watch page to retrive the play duration - dont' need to downloard the full thing for it. 
#	- download captions and convert it to srt that VLC can play 
#	- prefer p60 over p30 videos
#	- network reconnect should re-establish things
#	- move to python3
#	- mkdir if folder for -f doesn't exist. 
#	- ask if the file to be downloaded already exists
#----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Code TODO 
#	- clean up overall flow of messages on console and in logs 
#	- use exceptions instead of status codes/errors in most return calls
# 	- generalized function for page download 
#	- generlize id from url for watch, playlist, channel 
#	- get rid of print_stream_map functions. Simplify with pretty_print 
#	- make item logger global (how will you handle in multithread situation?) 
#	- centrlized all standard strings (including youtube.com/xxx where we are assuming known url
